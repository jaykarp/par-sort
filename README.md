# par-sort
## Parallel Sorting Implementations:
In this project we implemented different sequential sorting algorithms in haskells functional paradigm.

1. QuickSort
2. MergeSort
3. BitonicSort

We then continued to create the parallel counterparts of these algorithms.
Finally, we implemented a Hybrid sort which is a combination of the best features of the other sorts we implemented.
